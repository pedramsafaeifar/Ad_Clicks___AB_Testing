Using Python and its associated modules, in this notebook I performed data analysis on the data obtained from testing two distinct advertisements.

**Background:**

An A/B Test is being conducted by an online shoe retailer, where they are testing two distinct versions of an advertisement. These ad versions are being displayed in emails and banner ads across platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. The retailer aims to assess the performance of each ad version on different platforms for each day of the week. 
To assist them in data analysis, we will utilize aggregate measures and hypothesis testing to evaluate the performance metrics.
